# Cambridge_Engineering_PartIB_Device_Programming

This is the repo for the device programming course set by CUED.
One can refer to: https://cued-partib-device-programming.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html  
to get official instructions.  

Note that code must be run under the online environment provided by ARM: Keil Studio  
https://studio.keil.arm.com/  
to get access to the mbed environment that includes many features that must be used during programming.
